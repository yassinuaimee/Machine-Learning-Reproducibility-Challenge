# Towards Learning Convolutions from Scratch

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of our **Reproducibility Challenge** project for **EE-411 (2023-2024)**. We investigate the claims from the paper **"Towards Learning Convolutions from Scratch"** by Behnam Neyshabur, focusing on training **fully connected networks** with **Î²-lasso regularization** to learn convolutional-like filters.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- **Goal**: Evaluate the effectiveness of learning convolutions from scratch by replacing convolutional layers with fully connected ones trained using **Î²-lasso optimization**.
- **Approach**:
  - Reproduced and analyzed key results from the paper, particularly **Table 2, Fig. 3, and Fig. 4**.
  - Implemented **shallow neural networks** to compare different architectures:
    - **Sconv (Shallow Convolutional Network)**
    - **Slocal (Shallow Local Network)**
    - **SFC (Shallow Fully Connected Network)**
    - **3FC (3-Layer Fully Connected Network)**
  - Evaluated performance on **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN** datasets.
  - Studied the impact of **Î²-lasso** in enforcing sparsity.
